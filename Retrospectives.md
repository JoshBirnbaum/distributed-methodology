# Distributed Retrospectives

## Introduction

This document provides guidance for how to run distributed retrospectives.
This guide can be reviewed by the whole team but is most important
for the facilitator. The facilitator should be chosen by the team
and does not have to be the project mentor.

## Goal

The goal of the retrospective is to understand what we learned and what we have
yet to learn about making the project. This improves the team's operation.
One way particular way this happens is by changing the methodology.

## Preparations

Set up a whiteboard for the retrospective. The board should have three columns:
"What worked well," "What can be improved," "Appreciations," and 
"Action Items".

Prepare an ordering of team members that will be used for an early
step in the retrospective. This will be used not only for speaking, but for an order to go up and write on the board.

## Agenda

1. *Prime Directive:* Read aloud the Retrospective Prime Directive, which is
   taken from Norm Kerth's _Project Retrospectives: A Handbook for Team Review_.

    >Regardless of what we discover, we understand and truly believe that
   everyone did the best job they could, given what they knew at the time, their
   skills and abilities, the resources available, and the situation at hand.

1. *Check-in*: Let everyone know the order in which they will be invited to speak.
   In that order, each person briefly shares how they think the sprint went.
   
   Note that this is not time for consensus-building: it is fine to quietly
   disagree. You may ask clarifying questions. A good way to approach this 
   is to try to restate what you heard in your own words, so that you can tell
   if you're on the same page.

1. *Individual Reflections*: Set a timer for 8 minutes. During this time,
   team members write their responses to the first
   three columns on the whiteboard. Don't write anything on the board yet:
   just write them individually. 

   Remember that the fourth column is only used later in the meeting. 
   Do not add anything to it yet.

1. *Gather Responses*: Once the timer goes off, team members go up in the assigned order to write their
   responses on the whiteboard. 

1. *Read Appreciations*: Go through the appreciations column and let the
    person who shared each item read it aloud. 

1. *Group Responses*: Walk the team through the process of removing
    duplicates in the first two columns.
    This also provides an opportunity for team members
    to clarify what has been written in the collumns. 

1. *Vote for discussion topics*: Team members vote on which items
    to discuss in more detail. Invite team members to add themselves
    to items in order to show their votes. There is no minimum or 
    maximum number of votes.

1. *Discuss*: Choose the top few (2&ndash;3) items based on votes and
    open the floor for discussion. 
    When there is an action item, ask for a champion. If there is consensus
    and a champion, then document both on the fourth column of Trello.

1. *Close*: Conclude the meeting with a quick meta-retrospective. Ask
    the team about the retrospective itself: what was good, what was bad,
    what would they change. Be sure to write these down for inclusion
    in the retrospective report. Thank the participants.

## After the Retrospective

Reasonably soon after the meeting, the facilitator writes a retrospective
report. This report provides the team with a record of the meeting. As such, it
must include a copy of the Trello board along with a summary of major themes and
findings. Circulating the report among the team ensures that this section
represents the opinions of the team and not just the perspective of the
facilitator. The report must also clearly present any changes to the methodology
that were approved by the team during the discussion.
