# Introduction

This document provides an introduction to the methodology. It includes
definitions and principles appropriate for incorporating the methodology into an
academic studio course.

## Definitions

It will help our communication to establish some definitions. We are one
_team_. The students are therefore _team
members_. The professor wears a few different hats: as a _blank_, he
does _this_; as an _blank_, he
does _this_; as an _blank_, he
does _this_;

A _production day_ is a day after the preproduction period that is not set aside
for any other purpose. An _iteration_ or a _sprint_ is a period of time during
which the team makes progress on a set of goals. Each iteration begins with a
_planning meeting_, during which that iteration's goals are established. Each
iteration ends with a _review meeting_, during which the results of the
iteration are compared against the goals, and a _retrospective meeting_, during
which the team reflects upon and improves their processes. Each iteration
produces an _increment_, also known as a _potentially shippable product_ or an
_executable release_.

There will be opportunities to update the methodology as part of each
retrospective meeting.

## Background and References

We recognize and seek [the seven properties of highly successful projects](https://www.projectsmart.co.uk/7-properties-of-highly-successful-projects-from-crystal-clear.php),
which are summarized below:
1. Frequent Delivery
2. Reflective Improvement
3. Osmotic Communication
4. Personal Safety
5. Focus
6. Easy Access to Expert Users
7. Technical Environment with Automated Tests, Configuration Management, and
   Frequent Integration

We uphold the value of _safety_ through practices inspired by
[Anzeneering](https://www.industriallogic.com/blog/anzeneering/). In particular,
[Joshua Kerievsky's articulation of Stop Work Authority in
software](https://medium.com/@JoshuaKerievsky/stop-work-authority-d853f6a3c42d)
provides guidance to us on how to maintain safety in the studio, whether
in-person or distributed.

We take an _iterative_ and _incremental_ to producing work.
- _Iterative_ means that we work in iterations, with each iteration of
  production being bookended by a planning meeting at the beginning and review
  and retrospective meetings at the end.
- _Incremental_ means that each iteration produces an increment that is an
  executable release or potentially shippable product. That is, each iteration
  produces a product which can be used by the team or community.

We believe that what we produce&mdash;are made by human
beings, and so we respect [the Heart of Agile](https://heartofagile.com).
