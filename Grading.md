# Grading

This document describes a formal method for assigning grades to students
based on their engagement with the academic studio model.


## Assumptions

This document assumes that students are enrolled in a 3&nbsp;credit-hour course
over a 15-week semester, which, according to federal student aid law, should
equate to nine effort-hours per week. If these do not match your situation,
adjust the metrics appropriately.

This document also assumes that students are acting in good faith. 

## Policy

Students track their time that they commit to the project.
Most of these hours will be during scheduled team meetings, which should
simplify record-keeping.

At the end of an iteration, each student provides a three-part report on their
commitments and contributions during the sprint. Two parts of this
end-of-iteration report are the same for all students.

- A statement of hourly commitment
- A statement of commitment to the methodology

The third part is different depending on whether a student facilitated
the retrospective meeting. The student who facilitates the meeting may submit
the retrospective report. 

Other students submit a portfolio piece and reflection. The portfolio piece is
an artifact that you created during the sprint that manifests your contribution.
Examples include artwork, audio, documentation, paper prototypes, source
code, or any other manifestation of contribution. The reflection is an essay that contextualizes the piece, emphasizing how
this work affected your team. Note that I use &ldquo;essay&rdquo; in the
classical sense: an _essay_ is an attempt to understand, and hence, it must be
clear and it must support its argument with theory and evidence. Put another
way, the writing the reflection essay is training for reflective practice, for
lifetime learning, and for presenting your work to potential employers. As such,
it also provides the instructor with assessment material that is required for giving a grade for the course.
