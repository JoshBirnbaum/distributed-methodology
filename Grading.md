# Grading

This document describes a formal method for assigning grades to students
based on their engagement with the academic studio model.


## Assumptions

This document assumes that students are enrolled in a 3&nbsp;credit-hour course
over a 15-week semester, which, according to federal student aid law, should
equate to nine effort-hours per week. If these do not match your situation,
adjust the metrics appropriately.

This document also assumes that students are acting in good faith. 

## Policy

Students track their time that they commit to the project.
Most of these hours will be during scheduled studio meetings, which should
simplify record-keeping.

At the end of an iteration, each student reports on the extent to which they
kept their commitment to the team. Two parts of this end-of-iteration report
are the same for all students.

- A statement of hourly commitment
- A statement of commitment to the methodology

The third part is different depending on whether a student facilitated
the retrospective meeting. A student who does not facilitate the meeting
is expected to write a short reflection on one particular contribution
they made during the past iteration. This is essentially a reflection
on a portfolio piece, an intentional thinking about how your work
affected your team.
The student who facilitated the meeting may instead submit the retrospective
report to fulfill this obligation.
